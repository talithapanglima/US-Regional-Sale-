## Project Objective
Channel Fusion Company is the largest retail markets of any country in the world and many of the world's largest retail companies are located there. Over the last couple of decades, total retail sales numbers in the United States have grown considerably, from just under 1.600 U.S. dollars in 2018 to more than 2.500 dollars in 2020. This was an increase of more than 800 dollars from the previous year, and growth is expected to continue over the coming years, albeit at a slower rate, reaching roughly 7.9 trillion U.S. dollars in retail sales by 2024.
