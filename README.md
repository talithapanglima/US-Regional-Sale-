# US-Regional-Sale-
## Project Objective
Channel Fusion Company is the largest retail markets of any country in the world and many of the world's largest retail companies are located there. Over the last couple of decades, total retail sales numbers in the United States have grown considerably, from just under 1.600 U.S. dollars in 2018 to more than 2.500 dollars in 2020. This was an increase of more than 800 dollars from the previous year, and growth is expected to continue over the coming years, albeit at a slower rate, reaching roughly 7.9 trillion U.S. dollars in retail sales by 2024.

## Recommendations from The Analysis that I did
1. Develop targeted marketing campaigns during peak sales months and adjust inventory levels to meet the expected demand surge. This will help to maximize sales and ensure product availability during high-traffic periods.
2. Focus on expanding operations in Texas, and Florida, as these states drive significant revenue, and Develop state-specific advertising campaigns for Texas, and Florida, to cater to local preferences and cultural nuances.
3. Increase inventory and marketing efforts for "Home DÃ©cor & Furnishings" and "Furniture" to capitalize on high demand. Consider introducing new product lines or bundles in these categories to boost sales further.
4. Organize in-store workshops showcasing how our products can benefit businesses. This can provide an opportunity for potential customers to experience the products firsthand and engage with sales representatives.
